    "## Introduction\n",
    "To get an indication of possible essential genes, the number of transposon insertions and amount of reads per transposon is plotted along the length of the gene. If a gene consists of a large area without any insertions or with little reads, this might indicate an essential (region of a) gene.\n",
    "However, it sometimes might happen that non-essential genes have no transposons. This can mulitple reasons, most notable which are:\n",
    "- Sequencing reads that map to repeated sequences were discarded during alignment. If these repeated sequences occur in protein coding regions in the genome, then these regions might be removed during alignment and therefore these genes appear to be free of transposon, even though these genes might not be essential.\n",
    "- Annotated dubious ORFs might overlap with essential genes. So the dubious ORFs are not essential, but have no insertions because of the overlap.\n",
    "- Sometimes genes might not be essential in normal growth conditions (and hence are not annotated as such), but in particular lab conditions some genes can become essential (for example genes involved in the metabolism of certain sugars).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, sometimes transposons occur in essential genes. This can be because not the complete gene is essential, but only certain domains of the gene are essential. The non-essential domain can be truncated and still create a function protein with only the essential domains left. Also, sometimes the first and/or last few basepairs can be truncated while still leave a gene that can be transcribed and translated in a functional protein.\n",

    "This function creates a bar plot with the number of reads per transposon for regions in a gene. It also shows the exact locations of the insertions along the gene. The width of the bars are chosen such that each bar include a fixed amount of transposons. A maximum threshold is set to account for the situation where there are little or no transposons present for large portion of the gene.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next to the bar plot, this function also creates a violin plot where a distribution is shown for the distance (in terms of basepairs) between subsequent insertions. This is compared with the distance between insertions in the entire chromosome the gene is in. If the median distance between insertions is significantly higher in the gene compared to the chromosome, then this might be an indication of an essential gene."

    "The resulting barplot shows the insertions (represented by the small black bars) along the gene. The blue bars indicate the number of reads per transposon in that bin. This shows how the insertions and reads are distributed along the gene.\n",
    "The reading orientation is indicated by a + (forward reading) or - (reverse reading). The numbers for the mean are given together with the standard deviation (note that this is typically very large). Therefore a more reliable measure might be the percentiles given as the 25th, 50th and the 75th percentile respectively.\n",

    "The violinplot shows the distribution of the amount of basepairs between subsequent insertions for both the gene (green) and the chromomsome the gene is in (red). A significant difference in the median basepairs between insertions might indicate potential essential genes."
