

Hello there 😄 Welcome to this Jupyter Book instance to document our data processing pipeline to analyze data from the technique : **Sa**turated **T**ransposition **A**nalysis in **Y**east. 

## Status of the project

- [Beta release on Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4636310) 

  
### Next steps

:::{panels}
:container: +full-width text-center
:column: col-lg-6 px-2 py-2
:card:

**Publication in JOSS** ✍
^^^
Make the software package ready to be published in [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

  <!-- - Automated testing with continuous integration
    - Comand line interface with a pip install mode
    - GitFlow implementation for contributors to the software -->

---
**Reproducible data analysis** 🚀
^^^
Reproducible data analysis through a configuration file.
 - e.g. Make a manifest (docker compose)


---
**Multiple files analysis** 🎁
^^^
Allow mulitple files to be processed at once using a for-loop in the bash script.
Currently only one dataset at the time can be processed, but this can be extended to allow a series of datasets to be processed in a for-loop.


---
**Python package** 🛰
^^^
Build a python package that is pip installable for the ease of use for other researchers.
